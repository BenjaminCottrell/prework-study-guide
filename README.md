# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was designed as a result of wanting to have a place to quickly review prework items in a convenient study guide. By having a study guide easily available, it is possible to review prior learned subjects in a succinct fashion, allowing for quicker recollection and reuptake of concepts. With this in mind, it is not necessary to scour through all previously learned content to revise on the most important subjects and ideas from the prework curriculum. Along the way I was able to use concepts learned in the prework to develop a guide that will reinforce those very same concepts for future use.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide allows the user to review notes on a number of topics covered by coding bootcamp prework, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. By opening the DevTools console, we can see the Javascript running, and the JavaScript gives us a suggestion for what to study first as well.
